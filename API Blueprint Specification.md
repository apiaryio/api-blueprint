<a name="Introduction"></a>
## 1. Introduction
This document is a full specification of the [API Blueprint](http://apiblueprint.org) Language (hereafter "API Blueprint"). API Blueprint is a **Web API documentation language**.

Please refer to the [API Blueprint homepage](http://apiblueprint.org) for an introduction to API Blueprint.

<a name="Language"></a>
## 2. API Blueprint
API Blueprint is essentially a set of semantical assumption on top of a [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown) syntax that are used to define a Web API. 

In additional to regular Markdown syntax API Blueprint inherits some [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown) features and uses some parts of [MultiMarkdown](http://fletcherpenney.net/multimarkdown) syntax.

Before proceeding with this document please make yourself familiar with the basic [Markdown Syntax](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax) as well as with the Metadata and Cross-References sections of [MultiMarkdown Syntax](https://github.com/fletcher/MultiMarkdown/blob/master/Documentation/MultiMarkdown%20User%27s%20Guide.md#multimarkdown-syntax-guide) and GitHub Flavored Markdown's [newlines & fenced code blocks](https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown).

<a name="Document"></a>
## 3. API Blueprint Document
API Blueprint document is a Markdown document where a Web API is described.

The document itself is divided into several logical **sections** which represent the **API Blueprint Document Structure**.

<a name="Sections"></a>
### 3.1. Sections
A section represents a logical unit of a API blueprint. For example an API overview, a group of resources or a resource definition. A section can contain other (nested) section. For example a resource definition might contain a resource URI parameter's description as its subsection.

Sections are recognized by a **reserved section name** or a **URI template** in a **Markdown header**. Alternatively some sections might be recognized by a **reserved section name** in a **Markdown list item** followed by a newline.

Each section or subsection has a strictly defined name, meaning and expected content. Anything between a section start and another section start is considered to be part of the section. **Avoid** using reserved section names â€“ **keywords** in other Markdown headers but section headers.

<a name="ReservedSectionNames"></a>
### 3.2. Reserved Section Names
Reserved keywords are:

- Markdown Headers:
	- HTTP methods: `GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, OPTIONS, PATCH, PROPPATCH, LOCK, UNLOCK, COPY, MOVE, MKCOL, HEAD`
	- URI templates (e.g. `/resource/{id}`)
	- Combinations of HTTP method and URI Template (e.g. `GET /resource/{id}`)
	- `Group`

- Markdown List items: 
	- `Request`
	- `Response`
	- `Body`
	- `Schema`
	- `Model`
	- `Header` & `Headers`
	- `Parameter` & `Parameters`
	- `Values`

**NOTE:** With the exception of HTTP methods keywords the section keywords are **case insensitive**.

Sections are discussed in [API Blueprint Document Structure](#DocumentStructure). Some section names might contain variable components such as an [identifier](#Identifiers) or other modifiers. See the relevant section's entry to find out more about how its section name is built.

<a name="NestedSections"></a>
### 3.3. Nested Sections
Some sections might be nested under another section. To nest a section simply **increase** its **header level** and / or **list item indentation**.

Example:

	# Section A
	... Section A content ...

	## Nested Section of Section A
	... Nested Section content ...

	# Section B
	... Section B content...
	
Nested List Item Sections:
	
	+ Section C
	  ... Section C content...

		+ Section D
		  ... Section D content...

Which sections can be nested depends upon the section in case, as described in the relevant [API Blueprint Document Structure](#DocumentStructure) section's entry.

<a name="OtherMarkdownHeaders"></a>
### 3.4. Other Markdown Headers
It is possible to use any other Markdown header in a section description as long as it does not clash with the [Reserved Section Names](#ReservedSectionNames). It is considered good practice to keep the header level nested under the actual section.

<a name="SpecialSections"></a>
### 3.5. Sections without keyword
There are **two additional** sections of an API Blueprint Document that are not recognized by a keyword: The [Metadata Section](#MetadataSection) and the [API Name & Overview Section](#APINameOverviewSection). These sections are discussed in detail in the [API Blueprint Document Structure](#DocumentStructure).

<a name="Identifiers"></a>
### 3.6. Identifiers 
Several sections names might include an identifier. An identifier is any **non-empty combination** of a **alphanumerical character**, **underscore**, **dash**  and a **space** unless stated otherwise. **No other characters** (e.g. punctation or other whitespace characters) **are allowed**. An identifier **should not** include any [reserved keyword](ReservedSectionNames).

Example:

	My Awesome Message

	-- or --

	my-awesome-message_2

<a name="DocumentStructure"></a>
## 4. API Blueprint Document Structure
Description of the structure of API Blueprint Document. Every section is, by default, optional. However, the blueprint document should contain at least one [Resource](#ResourceSection) Section.

	+ Metadata
	|
	+ API Name & Overview Section
	|
	...
	| 
	+ Resource Section 
	|	|
	|	...	
	...


<a name="MetadataSection"></a>
### 4.1. Metadata Section
**Optional**. API metadata.

This section is **recognized** as [MultiMarkdown Metadata](https://github.com/fletcher/MultiMarkdown/blob/master/Documentation/MultiMarkdown%20User%27s%20Guide.md#metadata). It starts at the beginning of the document and ends with the first Markdown element that is not recognized as MutliMarkdown Metadata.

This section **does not include** any **other sections**.

Metadata keys and its values are tool-specific. Please refer to relevant tool documentation for the list of supported keys.

Example:

	HOST: http://blog.acme.com
	FORMAT: 1A

<a name="APINameOverviewSection"></a>
### 4.2. API Name & Overview Section
**Optional**. Name of the API in the form of a Markdown header.

This section is **recognized** as the **first** Markdown header in a blueprint document. Its content is considered to represent the **API name**.

This section can contain **further Markdown-formatted content**. If content is provided it is considered to represent the API overview / description. 

This section **does not include** any **other sections**.

Example:

	# My API Name

	-- or --

	# Basic ACME Blog API
	Welcome to the **ACME Blog** API. This API provides access to the **ACME Blog** service.

<a name="ResourceGroups"></a>
### 4.3. Resource Group Section
**Optional**. This sections represents a group of resources - [Resource Sections](#ResourceSection).

This section is **recognized** by the `Group` **keyword** followed by a name of group in the form of a [identifier](#Identifiers). The syntax is as follows:

	# Group <identifier>

A Group section may contain **further Markdown-formatted content**. If a content is provided it is considered to represent the group description.

A Group **should include** at least one [Resource Section](#ResourceSection).

Example:

	# Group Blog Posts
	Resources in this groups are related to **ACME Blog** posts.

	## GET /posts{/id}
		...

	## PUT /posts
		...

	# Group Authors
	## GET /authors
		...

	# Comments
		...

<a name="ResourceSection"></a>
### 4.3.1 Resource Section
**Optional**. Definition of exactly **one** API [**resource**](http://www.w3.org/TR/di-gloss/#def-resource) specified by its *URI* **OR** a **set of resources** (a resource template) matching its *URI template*.

An blueprint document can contain multiple sections for the same resource (or resource set), as long as their HTTP methods differ. However it is considered good practice to group multiple HTTP methods under one resource (resource set).

This section is **recognized** by an [RFC 6570 URI template](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6570) written in a Markdown header. Optionally the header can contain **one** leading [HTTP Request Method](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol#Request_methods) in which case **the rest of this section** is considered to **represent the [Action Section](#ResourceActionSection).**

Alternatively this section is **recognized** by a MultiMarkdown header with URI Template specified in its [explicit label](https://github.com/fletcher/MultiMarkdown/blob/master/Documentation/MultiMarkdown%20User%27s%20Guide.md#automatic-cross-references).

This section might be a top level section or nested under a [Resource Group Section](#ResourceGroups).

This section may contain **further Markdown-formatted content**. If a content is provided it is considered to represent the Resource description.

If no **HTTP Request Method** is specified, this section **should include** at least one nested [Action Section](#ResourceActionSection).

In addition to any mandatory nested sections this section **may include** the following additional subsections:
 
* [Parameters Section](#ResourceParametersSection)
* [Headers Section](#ResourceHeadersSection)
* [Model Section](#ResourceModelSection)
* [Action Section](#ResourceActionSection),  if **no** HTTP Request Method is specified

Example:

	# PUT /posts

	-- or --

	# GET /posts{/id}

	-- or --

	# /posts
	
	-- or --
	
	# My Resource [/resource]

<a name="ResourceParametersSection"></a>
#### 4.3.1.1. Resource Parameters Section
**Optional**. Description of [Resource Section](#ResourceSection)'s URI parameters. Content of this section is subject to additional formatting.

This section is **recognized** by the `Parameters` reserved **keyword** written as a Markdown list item. 

This section consist of nested list items with additional formatting. **Full syntax of one parameter description is:

	+ <parameter name> [= `<default value>`] [([required | optional ], [<type>], [`<example value>`])] [... <description>]

		[<additional description>]
		
		[+ Values:
			+ `<enumeration element 1>` 
			+ `<enumeration element 2>`
			...
			+ `<enumeration element N>`]	

Note the abbreviated syntax can be freely mixed with the full syntax.

Where:

* `<parameter name>` is the parameter name as written in [Resource Section](#ResourceSection)'s URI (e.g. "id").
* `<description>` is any **optional** Markdown-formatted description of the parameter.
* `<additional description>` is any additional **optional** Markdown-formatted description of the parameter.
* `<default value>` is an **optional** default value of the parameter â€“ a value that is used when no value is explicitly set (optional parameters only).
* `<example value>` is an **optional** example value  of the parameter (e.g. `1234`).
* `<type>` is the **optional** parameter type as expected by the API (e.g. "number").
* `Values` is the **optional** enumeration of possible values
*  and `<enumeration element n>` represents an element of enumeration type.
* `required` is the **optional** specifier of a required parameter (this is the **default**)
* `optional` is the **optional** specifier of an optional parameter.

This section does not have to list every URI parameter. It **should not**, however, contain parameters that are not specified in the URI.

Example:

	# GET /posts{/id}
	+ Parameters

		+ id ... Id of a post.

	-- or --

		+ id (number) ... Id of a post.

	-- or --

		+ id (required, number, `1001`) ... Id of a post.

	-- or --

		+ id = `20` (optional, number, `1001`) ... Id of a post.

<a name="ResourceModelSection"></a>
#### 4.3.1.3 Resource Model Section
**Optional**. A [resource manifestation](http://www.w3.org/TR/di-gloss/#def-resource-manifestation) - a representation of the resource as a [Payload](#Payload).

This section is **recognized** by the `Model` **keyword** followed an optional media type written in a Markdown list item. 

The Full list section syntax is as follows:

	+ Model [(<media type>)]

The Model defined in this section can be **referred later by it's resource identifier** from any other [Request](#ActionRequestSection) or [Response](#ActionResponseSection) payload sections, including those of the following [Resource sections](#ResourceSection).

Refer to MultiMarkdown [cross references](https://github.com/fletcher/MultiMarkdown/blob/master/Documentation/MultiMarkdown%20User%27s%20Guide.md#automatic-cross-references) for details on cross referencing. 

Refer to the [Payloads](#Payload) discussion for a detailed description of this section content. 

Example:

	# My Resource [/resource]
	+ Model (text/plain)
		
			Hello World
			
	## Retrieve My Resource [GET]
	+ Response 200
		
		[My Resource][]

<a name="ResourceActionSection"></a>
#### 4.3.1.4 Resource Action Section
**Expected** if there is no HTTP method specified in the parent [Resource Section](#ResourceSection)'s header. **Illegal** otherwise. 

This section represents an action to be performed on the parent resource. It defines at least one complete HTTP transaction.

This section is **recognized** by one of the [HTTP Request Methods](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol#Request_methods) written in capitals as a Markdown header.

Alternatively this section is **recognized** by a MultiMarkdown header with a HTTP Request Method specified in its [explicit label](https://github.com/fletcher/MultiMarkdown/blob/master/Documentation/MultiMarkdown%20User%27s%20Guide.md#automatic-cross-references).

This section can contain **further Markdown-formatted content**. If a content is provided it is considered to represent this action's description.

**Optional**. Description of exactly *one* [HTTP request](http://www.w3.org/TR/di-gloss/#def-http-request).

This section is **recognized** by the `Request` reserved **keyword** written in a Markdown header. The `Request` keyword may be followed by an [identifier](#Identifiers) of this request. In the case an HTTP body is specified the `Request` keyword (and possible identifier) might be followed by a HTTP Body [Media Type (MIME type)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_media_type) enclosed in brackets.

The Full Request Subsection list syntax is as follows:

	+ Request [<identifier>] [(<Media Type>)]

This subsection **must** be nested under an [Action Section](#ResourceActionSection).

This subsection is a specific type of [Payload](#Payload) carried by this request. See [Payloads Documentation](#Payload) for details about how to specify the content of this section.

One [Resource Section](#ResourceSection) or [Action Section](#ResourceActionSection) can contain **one or more different** (that is with a different identifier) Request Subsections.

Example:

	+ Request (text/plain)
		
			Hello World

	-- or --

One [Action Section](#ResourceActionSection) can contain **one or more different** (that is with different HTTP Status codes) Response Subsections.

Example:

	+ Response 201 (application/json)
		
				{ "message" : "created" }


<a name="Payload"></a>
## 5. Payload Section Structure
Payload sections represent the information transferred as payloads of an HTTP request or response messages. A Payload consists of meta information in the form of HTTP headers and content in the form HTTP body. Furthermore, an API Blueprint Payload might include a description, discussion of its message-body parameters and a validation schema.

A Payload **should have** its Media Type associated. A Payload's Media type represents the metadata always received or sent in the form of a HTTP `Content-Type` header.

Following section are payload sections: [Request Section](#ActionRequestSection), [Response Section](#ActionResponseSection) and [Model Section](#ResourceModelSection).  Refer to the specific payload sections on how to define a payload of the specific type. 

The Payload might include following **optional** subsections: 

* [Headers Subsection](#PayloadHeadersSection)
* [Body Subsection](#PayloadBodySection)
* [Schema Subsection](#PayloadSchemaSection)

Example (request payload section):

	+ Request (application/json)

		Any Markdown formatted *discussion* might be here.

		+ Headers
			
				X-My-Payload-Size: 42

		+ Parameters
			+ message ... A message.

		+ Body
			
				{ ... }

		+ Schema
		
				{ ... }
			
			
**If no subsection is specified the content of the payload section is considered to represent the [Body Subsection](#PayloadBodySection).**
			
Example:

	+ Request (application/json)
			
			{ ... }

<a name="PayloadHeadersSection"></a>
### 5.1. Payload Headers Section
**Optional**. Specifies the message-headers of a Payload section. The content of this section is subject to additional formatting.

This section is **recognized** by the `Headers` reserved **keyword** written in a Markdown list as follows:

	+ Headers

The subsection is formatted as a Markdown's [Pre-formatted code blocks](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax#precode) with the following syntax:

	<HTTP header name>: <value>

One HTTP header per line.

This subsection **does not include** any **other sections**.

Example:

	+ Request (application/json)
		+ Headers
	
	    		Accept-Charset: utf-8
		    	Connection: keep-alive
		    	Content-Type: multipart/form-data, boundary=AaB03x

<a name="PayloadBodySection"></a>
### 5.2. Payload Body Section
**Optional**. Specifies the message-body of a Payload section. Usually a [manifestation of a resource](http://www.w3.org/TR/di-gloss/#def-resource-manifestation).

This subsection is **recognized** by the `Body` reserved **keyword** written as a Markdown list item.

This subsection is an API Blueprint Document [Asset](#DocumentAssets).

This subsection **does not include** any **other subsections**.

Example:

	+ Request (application/json)
		+ Headers
	
				X-My-Payload-Size: 42

		+ Parameters
			+ message (string) ... A message from **ACME Blog** API.

		+ Body
	
				{ "message" : "Hello World." }

<a name="PayloadSchemaSection"></a>
### 5.3. Payload Schema Section
**Optional**. Where applicable, specifies a schema used to validate this Payload's [Body Section](PayloadBodySection) content.

This subsection is **recognized** by the `Schema` reserved **keyword** written as a Markdown list item.

This subsection is an API Blueprint Document [Asset](#DocumentAssets).

This subsection **does not include** any **other sections**.

<a name="DocumentAssets"></a>
## 6. Assets
An API Blueprint Document Asset is simply a resource (not to be confused with API Resource) â€“ an atomic data used in [payloads](#Payload).

<a name="InlineDocumentAsset"></a>
### 6.1. Inline Asset
In its simplest form an asset is essentially a Markdown [Pre-formatted code block](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax#precode). The sole content of this block is considered to represent the Asset's data.

Example:

	# Asset Name
		
		{ "message" : "Hello World." }
		
	-- or --
	
	+ Asset Name

			{ "message" : "Hello World." }


Using GitHub Flavored Markdown [Fenced Code blocks](https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown#fenced-code-blocks):


	# Asset Name
	
	```	
	{ "message" : "Hello World." }
	```
		
	-- or --
	
	+ Asset Name

		```
		{ "message" : "Hello World." }
		```
