# API Blueprint Tutorial

Welcome to an API Blueprint Tutorial! This tutorial will take you through the
basics of the API Blueprint language. We’re going to build an API blueprint
step by step for a service called Polls – a simple API allowing consumers to
view polls and vote in them. You can take a look at the 
[full version][Poll API Blueprint] of the blueprint used in this tutorial for
reference.

## API Blueprint

The first step for creating a blueprint is to specify the API Name and
metadata. This step looks as follows:

```apib
FORMAT: 1A

# Polls

Polls is a simple API allowing consumers to view polls and vote in them.
```

## Metadata

The blueprint starts with a metadata section. In this case we have specified
that `FORMAT` has the value of `1A`. The format keyword denotes the version of
the API Blueprint.

## API Name & Description

The first heading in the blueprint serves as the name of your API, which in
this case is "Polls". Headings start with one or more `#` symbols followed by a
title. The API Name here uses one hash to distinguish it as the first level.
The number of `#` you use will determine the level of the heading.

Following the heading is a description of the API. You may use further headings
to break up the description section.

## Resource Groups

Now it's time to start documenting the API resources. Using the `Group` keyword
at the start of a heading, we've created a group of related resources.

```apib
# Group Questions

Resources related to questions in the API.
```

## Resource

Within the questions resource group, we have a resource called "Question
Collection". This resource allows you to view a list of questions. The heading
specifies the URI used to access the resource inside of square brackets at the
end of the heading.

```apib
## Question Collection [/questions]
```

### Actions

API Blueprint allows you to specify each action you may make on a resource. An
action is specified with a sub-heading inside of a resource with the name of
the action followed by the HTTP method.

```apib
### List All Questions [GET]
```

An action should include at least one response from the server which must
include a status code and may contain a body. A response is defined as a list
item within an action. Lists are created by preceding list items with either a
`+`, `*` or `-`.

This action returns a `200` status code along with a JSON body.

```apib
+ Response 200 (application/json)

        [
            {
                "question": "Favourite programming language?",
                "published_at": "2014-11-11T08:40:51.620Z",
                "url": "/questions/1",
                "choices": [
                    {
                        "choice": "Swift",
                        "url": "/questions/1/choices/1",
                        "votes": 2048
                    }, {
                        "choice": "Python",
                        "url": "/questions/1/choices/2",
                        "votes": 1024
                    }, {
                        "choice": "Objective-C",
                        "url": "/questions/1/choices/3",
                        "votes": 512
                    }, {
                        "choice": "Ruby",
                        "url": "/questions/1/choices/4",
                        "votes": 256
                    }
                ]
            }
        ]
```

> **Note:** Specifying the media type after the response status code generates
> a `Content-Type` HTTP header. You do not have to explicitly specify the
> `Content-Type` header.

The polls resource has a second action which allows you to create a new
question. This action includes a description showing the structure you would
send to the server to perform this action.

```apib
### Create a New Question [POST]

You may create your own question using this action. It takes a JSON object
containing a question and a collection of answers in the form of choices.

+ question (string) - The question
+ choices (array[string]) - A collection of choices.
```

This action takes a JSON payload as part of the request as follows:

```apib
+ Request (application/json)

            {
                "question": "Favourite programming language?",
                "choices": [
                    "Swift",
                    "Python",
                    "Objective-C",
                    "Ruby"
                ]
            }
```

This example returns a `201` status code, along with HTTP headers and a body.

```apib
+ Response 201 (application/json)

    + Headers

            Location: /questions/1

    + Body

                {
                    "question": "Favourite programming language?",
                    "published_at": "2014-11-11T08:40:51.620Z",
                    "url": "/questions/1",
                    "choices": [
                        {
                            "choice": "Swift",
                            "url": "/questions/1/choices/1",
                            "votes": 0
                        }, {
                            "choice": "Python",
                            "url": "/questions/1/choices/2",
                            "votes": 0
                        }, {
                            "choice": "Objective-C",
                            "url": "/questions/1/choices/3",
                            "votes": 0
                        }, {
                            "choice": "Ruby",
                            "url": "/questions/1/choices/4",
                            "votes": 0
                        }
                    ]
                }
```

The next resource is “Question”, which represents a single question.

```apib
## Question [/questions/{question_id}]
```

### URI Template

The URI for the “Question” resource uses a variable component, expressed by
[URI Template][]. In this case, there is an ID variable called `question_id`,
represented in the URI template as `{question_id}`.

<a id="uri-parameters"></a>
### URI Parameters

URI parameters should describe the URI using a list of Parameters. For
“Question” it would be as follows:

```apib
+ Parameters
    + question_id (number) - ID of the Question in the form of an integer
```

The `question_id` variable of the URI template is a parameter for every action
on this resource. It's defined here using an arbitrary type `number`, followed
by a description for the parameter.

> Refer to API Blueprint Specification's [URI Parameters Section][] for more
> examples.

### Actions

This resource has an action to retrieve the question's detail.

```apib
### View a Questions Detail [GET]

+ Response 200 (application/json)

            {
                "question": "Favourite programming language?",
                "published_at": "2014-11-11T08:40:51.620Z",
                "url": "/questions/1",
                "choices": [
                    {
                        "choice": "Swift",
                        "url": "/questions/1/choices/1",
                        "votes": 2048
                    }, {
                        "choice": "Python",
                        "url": "/questions/1/choices/2",
                        "votes": 1024
                    }, {
                        "choice": "Objective-C",
                        "url": "/questions/1/choices/3",
                        "votes": 512
                    }, {
                        "choice": "Ruby",
                        "url": "/questions/1/choices/4",
                        "votes": 256
                    }
                ]
            }
```

#### Response Without a Body

This resource has a delete action. The server will return a 204 response
without a body.

```apib
### Delete [DELETE]

+ Response 204
```
