# Advanced Attributes API
Improving the previous [Attributes](08.%20Attributes.md) description example,
this API example describes the `Coupon` resource attributes (data structure)
regardless of the serialization format. These attributes can be later
referenced using the resource name.

These attributes are then reused in the `Retrieve a Coupon` action. Since they
describe the complete message, no explicit JSON body example is needed.

Moving forward, the `Coupon` resource data structure is then reused when
defining the attributes of the coupons collection resource – `Coupons`.

The `Create a Coupon` action also demonstrate the description of request
attributes – once defined, these attributes are implied on every `Create a
Coupon` request unless the request specifies otherwise. Apparently, the
description of action attributes is somewhat duplicate to the definition of
`Coupon` resource attributes. We will address this in the next 
[Data Structures](10.%20Data%20Structures.md) example.
