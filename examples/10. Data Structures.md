# Data Structures API
Following [Advanced Attributes](09.%20Advanced%20Attributes.md), this example demonstrates defining arbitrary data structure to be reused by various attributes description. 

Since a portion of `Coupon` data structure is shared between the `Coupon` definition itself and the `Create a Coupon` action, it was separated into a `Coupon Base` data structure in the `Data Strucutes` API Blueprint Section. Doing so enables us to reuse it as a base-type of other attribute definitions.
