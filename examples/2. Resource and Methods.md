# Resource and Methods API 
This API example demonstrates how to define a resource with multiple HTTP methods.

## Previous Example
[The Simplest API](https://github.com/apiaryio/api-blueprint/blob/master/examples/1.%20Simplest%20API.md)

## Next Example
[Named Resource and Methods](https://github.com/apiaryio/api-blueprint/blob/master/examples/3.%20Named%20Resource%20and%20Methods.md)

# /resource
This is our [resource](http://www.w3.org/TR/di-gloss/#def-resource). It is defined by its [URI](http://www.w3.org/TR/di-gloss/#def-uniform-resource-identifier) or, more precisely, by it's [URI Template](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6570).

This resource has no HTTP method specified but we will fix that soon. 

## Note to Advanced Readers
Note that *URI Template* usually does not represent *one* resource but rather a *set* of resources whose *URI* is matched by the *URI template*. In this case we talk about resource group or perhaps preferably about **resource cluster**.

## GET 
Here we define `GET` [method](http://www.w3schools.com/tags/ref_httpmethods.asp) for our resource `/resource`.

As with every good HTTP method it should return a [response](http://www.w3.org/TR/di-gloss/#def-http-response). Response always bears a status code. Code 200 is great as it means all is green. Responding with some data can be great idea as well so lets add plain text message to our response.

+ Response 200 (text/plain)

        Response from our resource!
        
## POST 
OK. lets add another method. This time to post data to our resource essentially a create method. We will need to post something in a [request](http://www.w3.org/TR/di-gloss/#def-http-request) and then send a response back confirming posting was a success.

+ Request (text/plain)

        A message to be posted.
        
+ Response 201 (text/plain)

        Created.
