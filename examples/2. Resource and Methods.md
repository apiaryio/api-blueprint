# Resource and Methods API 
This API example demonstrates how to define a resource with multiple HTTP methods.

## Previous Example
[The Simplest API](https://github.com/apiaryio/api-blueprint/blob/master/examples/1.%20Simplest%20API.md)

## Next Example
[Named Resource and Methods](https://github.com/apiaryio/api-blueprint/blob/master/examples/3.%20Named%20Resource%20and%20Methods.md)

# /message
This is our [resource](http://www.w3.org/TR/di-gloss/#def-resource). It is defined by its [URI](http://www.w3.org/TR/di-gloss/#def-uniform-resource-identifier) or, more precisely, by its [URI Template](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6570).

This resource has no HTTP method specified but we will fix that soon. 

## Note to Advanced Readers
Note that *URI Template* usually does not represent *one* resource but rather a *set* of resources whose *URI* is matched by the *URI template*. In this case we talk about a resource group or perhaps preferably about a **resource cluster**.

## GET 
Here we define the `GET` [method](http://www.w3schools.com/tags/ref_httpmethods.asp) for our resource `/message`.

As with every good HTTP method it should return a [response](http://www.w3.org/TR/di-gloss/#def-http-response). A response always bears a status code. Code 200 is great as it means all is green. Responding with some data can be a great idea as well so let's add a plain text message to our response.

+ Response 200 (text/plain)

        Hello World!
        
## POST 
OK, let's add another method. This time to post data to our resource (essentially a create method). We will need to post something in a [request](http://www.w3.org/TR/di-gloss/#def-http-request) and then send a response back confirming the posting was a success (Code 201 ~ Created).

+ Request (text/plain)

        A message to be posted.
        
+ Response 201 (text/plain)

        Created.
