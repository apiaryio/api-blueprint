# Data Structures API
Following [Advanced Attributes](09.%20Advanced%20Attributes.md), this example
demonstrates defining arbitrary data structure to be reused by various
attribute descriptions.

Since a portion of the `Coupon` data structure is shared between the `Coupon`
definition itself and the `Create a Coupon` action, it was separated into a
`Coupon Base` data structure in the `Data Structures` API Blueprint Section.
Doing so enables us to reuse it as a base-type of other attribute definitions.
