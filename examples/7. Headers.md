# Headers API
Let's discuss HTTP Headers - the metadata sent (or received) with our responses (or requests). As discussed in the [Responses example](https://github.com/apiaryio/api-blueprint/blob/master/examples/5.%20Responses.md) a payload (request or response) may include the `headers` entry to specify the headers to be sent (or received) with it.

In addition to this you can specify headers on both the `method` and `resource` levels. 

On the `method` level it represents headers that are always sent (or received) with **every** request or response made with a given `method` at a given `resource`. 

On the `resource` level it represents headers that are always sent (or received) with **every** request or response made at a given `resource`.
