# Gist Fox API
Gist Fox API is a **pastes service** similar to [GitHub's Gist](http://gist.github.com).

## Authentication
Currently the Gist Fox API does not provide authenticated access.

## Media Types
Where applicable this API uses the [HAL+JSON](https://github.com/mikekelly/hal_specification/blob/master/hal_specification.md) media-type to represent resources states and affordances.

Requests with a message-body are using plain JSON to set or update resource states.

## Error States
The common [HTTP Response Status Codes](https://github.com/for-GET/know-your-http-well/blob/master/status-codes.md) are used.

# Gist Fox API Root [/]
