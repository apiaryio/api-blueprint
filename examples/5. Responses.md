# Responses API
In this API example we will discuss what information can a response bear and how to define multiple responses. Technically a response represents a payload that is sent back in response to a request.

## Note to Advanced Readers
While responses (and requests) are payloads they do carry some additional information to the [HTTP Payload](http://www.w3.org/TR/di-gloss/#def-http-payload-entity). Furthermore payload as used in API Blueprint does not have to be complete from HTTP Payload point of view as some of its headers (will be discussed in [Headers](https://github.com/apiaryio/api-blueprint/blob/master/examples/7.%20Headers.md)) might be missing from its definition.

# My First Section

## My Super Awesome Message [/message]

### Retrieve Message [GET]
This method has **two** responses defined: "200" and "404". Also the response "200" bears additional information in the form of custom HTTP headers as well as it has a JSON schema associated.

+ Response 200 (application/json)

  This is *"all good"* response. Returned when everything went well. It bears our **message** to the world.

    + Headers

            X-My-Header: 42
            X-My-Another-Header: This is it.

    + Body

            { "message" : "Hello World!" }

    + Schema

            {
              "$schema": "http://json-schema.org/draft-03/schema",
              "id": "http://jsonschema.net",
              "required": false,
              "type": "object",
              "properties": {
                "message": {
                  "id": "http://jsonschema.net/message",
                  "required": false,
                  "type": "string"
                }
              }
            }

+ Response 404 (text/plain)

  This is the **infamous 404**. Something went wrong and our message was not found.

    + Body

            Not Found.
        
### Create Message [POST]
