### Retrieve a Message [GET]
This action has **two** responses defined: One returing a plain text and the other a JSON representation of our resource. Both has the same HTTP status code. Also both responses bear additional information in the form of a custom HTTP header. Note that both responses have set the `Content-Type` HTTP header just by specifying `(text/plain)` or `(application/json)` in their respective signatures.
