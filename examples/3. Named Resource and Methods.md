# My Super Awesome Message [/message]
OK, `My Super Awesome Message` probably isn't the best name for our resource but it will do for now. Note the URI `/message` is enclosed in square brackets. 

## Retrieve Message [GET]
Now this is informative! No extra explanation needed here. This method clearly retrieves the message.

+ Response 200 (text/plain)

        Hello World!
        
## Create Message [POST]
`Create a message` - nice and simple naming is the best way to go.

+ Request (text/plain)

        A message to be posted.
        
+ Response 201 (text/plain)

        Created.
