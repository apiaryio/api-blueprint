# The Simplest API
This is one of the simplest APIs written in the **API Blueprint**. 
One plain resource combined with a method and that's it! 

Nothing to see here. We will explain what is going on in the next installment - [Resource and Methods](https://github.com/apiaryio/api-blueprint/blob/master/examples/2.%20Resource%20and%20Methods.md). Let's [move on](https://github.com/apiaryio/api-blueprint/blob/master/examples/2.%20Resource%20and%20Methods.md)...

Note: As we progress through the examples, do not also forget to view the [**Raw**](https://raw.github.com/apiaryio/api-blueprint/master/examples/1.%20Simplest%20API.md) code to see what is really going on in the API Blueprint, as opposed to just seeing the output of the Github Markdown parser.
